""": One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number."""
