""": One common problem when prompting for numerical input
occurs when people provide text instead of numbers. When you try to convert
the input to an int, youâ€™ll get a TypeError. Write a program that prompts for
two numbers. Add them together and print the result. Catch the TypeError if
either input value is not a number, and print a friendly error message. Test your
program by entering two numbers and then by entering some text instead of a
number."""
try:
    x = input("Please enter the first number: ")
    x = int(x)

    y = input("Please enter the second numbr: ")
    y = int(y)

except ValueError:
    print("You must enter numbers instead of text, please try again.")

else:
    sum = x + y
    print( str(x) + " + " + str(y) + " = " + str(sum))
